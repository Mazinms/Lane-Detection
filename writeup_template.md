## Goal of the project is to detect and outline the profile road lane lines , using Opencv library.

### The implementation pipeline:

* 1. Mask RGB image to only allow for whit eand yellow pixels in a given range and zero otheriwse.

* 2. Convert the Masked image  into grayscale using opencv function.

* 3. Apply Gaussian Blurring with a kernel size of 5 to blur the image to reduce the noise.

* 4. Apply canny edge detection on the output image of Gaussian Blurring step.

* 5. Select a region of interest to mask on the output image of Step 3. Assuming camera is at the center of the the car.

* 6. Using opencv HoughLinesP function to find straight lines in the output image of Step 4. The output of using the HoughLinesP is a set of lines.

* 7. Separate the output set of lines into a Left or Right Lane based on their slope.

* 8. Extrapolated over each set of lines to find a optimal line which reduced the squared error for each line using polyfit function. 

* 9. Generate equally spaced points between the base of the image an 0.3 times the height of the image and then use the equation of the line generated by polyfit to fit to these points.

* 10. The extrapolated lines are drawn on the original image.

* 11. For video processing, use a buffer of size 24. The buffer is of fixed size and lines of every image frame will be appended, then the average of the buffer is taken smoothen out rate of update of lane drawn in the output video.

### Short comings in the current pipeline described:

* 1. Finding the obtimal color space to represent the information on an image. RGB was sufficient for this project but not obtimal for deployment grade lane detection application.
 
* 2. Scaling this algorithm is not optimal as working with higher resolution images as it will be computationally expensive when using the hough lane detection as it is a pixelwise operation. 

* 3. The order of the equation generated of the polyfit is not sufficient to for the challenge video with curved lane lines as the lane requre a higher order poly to fit them.

### Suggested Improvements:

* 1. Experiment with different color spaces other than RGB

* 2. Use a higher order polyfit to handle curved sections of roads
